image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

The problem addressed in this assignment is image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The objective was to classify images of animals into categories 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'horse'. Image classification is a core task in computer vision, with wide applications in areas such as medical imaging, security, autonomous driving, and entertainment. This assignment explores how a CNN model can be used to classify Those animals

Selected Data
The dataset chosen for this task is the CIFAR-10 dataset, a well-known image classification benchmark in the machine learning community. CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, including 'airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'.

After experimenting with a few models with different hyperparameter, I have chosen the final model, which achieved 85.55% accuracy on the training data and 82.84% accuracy on the validation data.
